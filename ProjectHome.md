Flot Extents is plugin for Flot Javascript plotting library. It produces **gantt**-like **bars** (**extents** on x axis). Extents may depend on each other. Dependencies visualized as arrows from one bar to another.

The focus as in Flot is **simple** usage.

A little sample, called 'Washing the Tank' (see svn/trunk/example too):
